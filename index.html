  <p style="margin-top:40px;">Korea is not a big country, so you can reach most cities and provinces by bus or train, not airplane. However, it is not easy for foreigners – especially first time visitor – to use public transportation in Korea due to the language problem. Especially, foreign language signs and reservation systems are not sufficient for the convenience of foreign visitors. Sometimes, taxi drivers require excessive fare for foreign guests. It can also be very inconvenient for group of family or business purpose visitor to travel with public transportation.</p>
